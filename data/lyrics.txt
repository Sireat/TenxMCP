[Verse 1]
Walking through the rain, memories remain
Every step I take, my heart begins to break
Searching for the light, in the darkest night
Hoping you'll come back, there's nothing I lack

[Chorus]
You're the melody that plays in my mind
The rhythm of my heart, so hard to find
Without you here, the music disappears
Come back to me, let our song be clear

[Verse 2]
Dancing in the shadows, following the echoes
Of your voice I hear, so distant yet so near
The beat goes on, but the harmony is gone
Waiting for the day, when you'll come back to stay

[Chorus]
You're the melody that plays in my mind
The rhythm of my heart, so hard to find
Without you here, the music disappears
Come back to me, let our song be clear

[Bridge]
Every note I play, every word I say
Reminds me of the time, when you were mine
The music never stops, but my heart still drops
When I realize, you're not by my side

[Chorus]
You're the melody that plays in my mind
The rhythm of my heart, so hard to find
Without you here, the music disappears
Come back to me, let our song be clear
